# Public-water-tank-MonitoringAnalysis
This project analyzes public water tank consumption data using Python and Pandas to monitor daily usage and remaining water levels. It visualizes water depletion trends, predicts possible shortages, and estimates future water availability. A threshold-based alert system is implemented to warn when the water level becomes critically low.
